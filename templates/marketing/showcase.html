                    <li>He also plans for future (<strong>old age high medical bills</strong>) that may not be covered by insurance, and <strong>health-related expenses</strong>, with <strong>higher inflation rate</strong> than normal living expenses</li>
                    <li>Dreams of <strong>travelling the world</strong> and travel fewer afterwards and stop travelling upon 80</li>
                    <li>Paying off his <strong>housing loan</strong> until 60</li>
                    <li>Upgrading his <strong>insurance</strong> in a few years, and he expects to pay until 80</li>
                    <li><strong>Changing his car</strong> every few years until a certain age</li>
                    <li>He expects some <strong>expenses to decrease as he ages</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <p>Considering risk management, he wants to manage the risks to his investments in case of market downturns.</p>

                <p>Martin wants to know if he can retire with his ongoing contributions during his working years, his rental income, and his budget for various expenses at different life stages. He also wants to know how long his retirement savings will last.</p>

                <h3>Savings</h3>
                <p>Martin currently has a pension fund worth <span class="value">$1,000,000</span>, which he expects to grow at a rate of <span class="value">5.5%</span>. However, he can only start withdrawing from this fund when he turns 55.</p>
                
                <p>He also has <span class="value">$500,000</span> invested in the S&P 500. Instead of assuming a consistent return rate, he wants to see the impact of retiring during a poor market, using 1999 as the retirement year. Since the fund's history is only available up to 2023, he assumes a return rate of <span class="value">7%</span> for the remaining years.</p>

                <p>When simulating retirement expenses, he considers the following:</p>

                <h3><i class="fas fa-plane"></i> Travel Budget: Dream Of Global Travel</h3>
                <p>He dreams of travelling the world during the first two years of his retirement, planning to spend a total of $100,000 on global adventures. After that, he expects to spend about $10,000 a year on travel when he anticipates slowing down his travels and stopping when he turns 75. He expects these costs to rise with an inflation rate of 3%</p>

                <h3><i class="fas fa-home"></i> Housing Loan Installment: To Be Settled Until Age 60</h3>
                <p>He currently has a housing loan, which requires him to pay $10,000 a year. This loan will continue until he turns 60, after which he will no longer have this expense.</p>

                <h3><i class="fas fa-shield-halved"></i> Insurance: Upgrade After 10 Years With Inflation Consideration</h3>
                <p>Currently, he pays $4,000 a year for his insurance. However, as he approaches 56 <em>(Note: For simulated purposes, he may consider upgrading now instead, while he is still healthy, avoid exclusion or reject possibility)</em>, he plans to upgrade his medical insurance to ensure it covers him until he turns 80. He realizes that the insurance he bought in his 20s may not be sufficient, especially considering the high inflation rates. He estimates this upgrade will cost an additional $3,000 per year. While uncertain if payments can cease at any age, he prefers to budget until age 80, which aligns with the coverage duration.</p>

                <h3><i class="fas fa-hospital"></i> Medical Bills: Prepare For High Expenses In Later Years</h3>
                <p>Starting at age 70, he anticipates needing about $20,000 a year (in today's money) for possible health-related expenses, e.g. medicines, follow-ups, physio visits, taking into account the possibility that insurance might not cover all expenses. He expects these costs to rise with an inflation rate of 8%. He does not plan for nursing home expenses <em>(Note: he may consider this)</em></p>

                <h3><i class="fas fa-car"></i> Car Replacement Every 7 Years</h3>
                <p>Starting at age 51, he plans to buy a new car every 7 years. Each time he buys a new car, it costs him an extra $60,000 beyond what he gets from selling his old car. When he turns 72, he expects to be his last car purchase. He doesn't anticipate purchasing a car afterward. He projects that car prices rise with an inflation rate of 2%.</p>

                <h3><i class="fas fa-utensils"></i> Food: Luxury Now, Simple Later</h3>
                <p>Currently, he spends about $20,000 a year on food, enjoying luxury dining occasionally. However, he anticipates that his lifestyle will become simpler as he ages. By the time he reaches 60, he plans to reduce his food budget to $15,000 a year. He also expects food prices to increase by about 6% annually due to inflation. If the market turns bad, he is prepared to reduce his food expenses to 80% of the original budget to minimize spending and more conservatively manage his finances.</p>

                <h3><i class="fas fa-bus"></i> Transport: More Driving Now, Less Later, Stop Afterward</h3>
                <p>Today. he spends about $4,000 a year on transport, covering costs such as petrol, insurance, parking, and maintenance. However, he expects these expenses to reduce to $3,000 a year after age 65, as he plans to drive less. By the time he reaches 80, he anticipates that he will stop driving altogether, eliminating these expenses. He expected these expenses to increase by about 4% annually due to inflation.</p>

                <p>He estimates that his annual expenses for bills, clothes, gadgets, repairs, and other miscellaneous items will be around $20,000. He assumes a general inflation rate of 3.5% for these expenses over the years.</p>

                <p>In terms of asset allocation, he plans to maintain a 70% stock and 30% bond mix until age 60. Then, he will shift to a 60% stock and 40% bond mix.

The third step pertains to defining retirement income or support during retirement, and the fourth step addresses risk management related to investments. You can jump to any step without following the sequence.</p>

            <ul class="feature-list">
                <li><strong>Summary:</strong> The first sheet is a summary that displays the total fund balance, expenses, incomes, and profit and loss. It also shows the net balance for the year.</li>
                <li><strong>Expenses:</strong> The second sheet will provide a detailed breakdown of individual expenses as they occur throughout the year and the total expenses for that year. In the case of an unfavourable market year, a user can configure expenses to switch to minimum spending. In that case, a comment in the column will indicate that the expense amount is based on minimum spending due to the unfavourable market conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Income:</strong> The third sheet will provide a detailed breakdown of individual income as it occurs throughout the year and the total income for that year.</li>
                <li><strong>Funds Flow:</strong> The fourth screen illustrates the cash flow into and out of the fund. This movement can result from pension fund contributions (directed into the pension fund), additional savings (allocated to the investment fund), profit and loss, withdrawals for expenses (based on withdrawal eligibility and sequence), and rebalancing (which may involve transferring funds from Fund A to Fund B). If a year is marked as an unfavourable market year and there's a pause in balancing from a risky fund to a safer fund, the rebalance column will display a comment indicating the pause.</li>
