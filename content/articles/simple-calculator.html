            Let's find out how long your money might last. 
            Imagine you have 
            <input type="number" id="money" value="500000" style="width: 100px;"> 
            dollars saved, and plan to withdraw 
            <input type="number" id="expenses" value="30000" style="width: 100px;"> 
            per year to cover your living expenses. 
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Each year, your expenses grow due to inflation. 
            Let's assume an annual inflation rate of 
            <input type="number" id="inflation" value="3.0" step="0.1" style="width: 60px;">%.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Based on this, your money will last approximately 
            <strong id="result">?</strong> years.
