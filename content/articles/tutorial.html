His situation might resonate with many of
          us. From this article, you will know how to use the system , and some
          ideas how it might help you. Let's explore his plan together.

          Retirement Simulation
        </h2>
        <p>
          Martin is 45 and, like many of us, wonders if retiring earlier than
          the traditional age 65 is possible. He's thoughtfully considering all
          aspects of his financial future:
        </p>
        <ul class="block-list">
          <li>
            He and his employer continue to
            <strong>contribute to the pension fund</strong>, and Martin also
            <strong>saves extra</strong> in his investments specifically for
            retirement
          </li>
          <li>
            Martin has <strong>rental income</strong> from his apartment that
            will continue after he retires
          </li>
          <li>
            Covering his current <strong>living expenses</strong> like food,
            transport, bills, and insurance. All these expenses have their
            inflation rate
          </li>
          <li>
            He also plans for future
            <strong> high medical bills & health-related expenses </strong
            >during <strong>old age</strong>, with
            <strong>higher inflation rate</strong> than normal living expenses
          </li>
          <li>
            Dreams of <strong>travelling the world</strong> and travel fewer
            afterwards and stop travelling upon 80
          </li>
          <li>A <strong>housing loan</strong> that runs until he's 60</li>
          <li>
            Upgrading his <strong>insurance</strong> in a few years, and he
            expects to pay until 80
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Changing his car</strong> every few years until a certain
            age
          </li>
          <li>
            He expects some <strong>expenses to decrease as he ages</strong>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Most importantly, Martin wants to know: If he retires at 50, will his
          money last? And how should he protect himself against market
          volatility?
        </p>

        <p>
          Let's see how Martin uses DynaRetire to find answers to these
          questions.

        <p>
          This year is <span class="value">2025</span>. Martin, 45, is planning
           to retire early at <span class="value">50</span>.
        </p>

        <h3 data-toc-skip>Savings</h3>
        <p>
          Martin currently has a pension fund worth
          <span class="value">$1,000,000</span>, which he expects to grow at a
          rate of <span class="value">5.5%</span>. However, he can only start
          withdrawing from this fund when he turns
          <span class="value">55</span>. This means for the first five years
          after retiring at 50, Martin will need to rely solely on his
          investment funds to cover all his expenses.
        </p>

        <p>
          He has <span class="value">$500,000</span> invested in the S&P 500.
          Instead of assuming a consistent return rate, he worried about the
          impact of retiring during a poor market, so he want to backtest
          against one of the worst market periods 1999 as the retirement year.
          For years beyond historical data, he uses a more
          typical <span class="value">7%</span> return. By planning for the
          worst, Martin can have better awareness how he want to adjust his plan
          based on his comfort level.

        <p>
          Let's look at how Martin anticipates his retirement needs will evolve
          over time. He doesn't believe his spending will stay the same
          throughout retirement - instead, he expects his needs and wants will
          naturally change as he ages.

        <h3 data-toc-text="Travel Budget">
          <i class="fas fa-plane"></i> Travel Budget: Dream Of Global Travel
        </h3>
        <p>
          Martin plans to spend <span class="value">$100,000</span> on travel
          during his first two years of retirement. After that, he'll spend
          about <span class="value">$10,000</span> each year until he's
          <span class="value">75</span>. He's not spreading his travel budget
          evenly across years - It is because he know that:
        </p>

        <ul class="bullet-list">
          <li>
            Health and mobility tend to be strongest in those early retirement
            years. The same money spent at different ages gives completely
            different experiences.
          </li>
          <li>
            Martin doesn't know how long his health will allow him to travel
          </li>
          <li>
            Life often brings unexpected responsibilities, like caring for aging
            parents, that can restrict travel later
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 data-toc-text="Housing Loan">
          <i class="fas fa-home"></i> Housing Loan Installment: To Be Settled
          Until Age 60
        </h3>
        <p>
          He currently has a housing loan, which requires him to pay
          <span class="value">$10,000</span> a year. This loan will continue
          until he turns <span class="value">60</span>, after which he will no
          longer have this expense.
        </p>
        <p>
          Martin has deliberately chosen not to pay off his housing loan before
          retirement. His loan's interest rate is significantly lower than both
          his pension fund returns and his expected investment returns. By
          keeping this lower-interest debt while his money grows in
          higher-return investments, he maintains more flexibility with his
          assets. This approach allows him to better manage his overall
          financial picture and optimize returns while maintaining liquidity for
          other needs.

        <h3 data-toc-text="Insurance">
          <i class="fas fa-shield-halved"></i> Insurance: Upgrade After 10 Years
          With Inflation Consideration
        </h3>
        <p>
          Martin currently allocates <span class="value">$4,000</span> annually
          for insurance. Looking ahead to age <span class="value">56</span>, he
          plans to enhance his coverage with an additional
          <span class="value">$3,000</span> per year to ensure protection until
          age <span class="value">80</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          While Martin's current plan is to upgrade at age
          <span class="value">56</span>, he's also weighing another option:
          upgrading his coverage sooner while still in good health. This is due
          to insurance companies typically assess risk based on health status at
          the time of application, and if later might lead to exclusions or even
          application rejections.
        </p>
        <p>
          Martin has allocated insurance expenses through age
          <span class="value">80</span>, which is the maximum his policy will
          cover. To Martin personal viewpoint, after 80s, he may prefer natural
          life progression over extensive medical interventions.

        <p>
          Starting at age <span class="value">70</span>, Martin allocates
          <span class="value">$20,000</span> annually (in today's dollars) for
          potential health-related expenses—medicines, specialist follow-ups,
          and physical therapy sessions—recognizing that insurance typically
          won't cover everything. He projects these costs will increase at a
          higher <span class="value">8%</span> inflation rate, reflecting the
          reality of rising healthcare costs.
        </p>

        <p>
          While his current plan doesn't include funding for long-term care
          facilities, Martin acknowledges this as an area for future
          consideration. His perspective is that family support combined with
          his medical budget might be sufficient, but he's keeping an open mind
          as he refines his plan over time.

          Martin currently enjoys occasional fine dining, spending about
          <span class="value">$20,000</span> yearly on food. As he gets older,
          he expects his tastes to become simpler. By age
          <span class="value">60</span>, he plans to reduce his food budget to
          <span class="value">$15,000</span> a year.
        </p>

        <p>
          He's factored in food inflation at
          <span class="value">6%</span> annually - higher than general
          inflation. And he's built in some flexibility too: if his investments
          perform poorly, he can cut back to <span class="value">80%</span> of
          his normal food budget until things improve.

          <span class="value">$60,000</span> (after trade-in value) for a new
          car every <span class="value">7</span> years. It is because getting
          car loans becomes difficult once retired! So, he plan this expenses
          every few years, not as yearly expenses
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking at his driving needs as he ages, Martin figures his last car
          purchase will be around age <span class="value">72</span> (which may
          last another 7 years or beyond). By then, rideshare services or family
          help might make more sense. He estimate a modest
          <span class="value">2%</span> annual price increase for cars, which
          tends to be lower than other expenses.

          Martin sees this category as more than just everyday items - it's also

          This is what Martin can save after paying for his day-to-day life. He

          his rental property as an important part of his "safe money" portfolio
          so he currently plans to keep the rental property for the long term.
          It also serves as his backup plan - if someday he needs a large amount
          of money, he could sell the property, especially if it has appreciated
          well over time.

          Minimum Spending, Load Balancing, Pause Selling, Asset Allocation
        </h2>
        <p>
          Knowing the market volatility could affect his retirement plan, Martin
          is thinking about ways to minimize the impact of running out of money
          too early - like at age 60, when he'd still have many years ahead.
        </p>

        <p>
          If his personal investment returns drop below
          <span class="value">3%</span> after retirement, he'll switch to
          minimum spending - hopefully reduce the money lost impact due to less
          selling for expenses. He'll also chose to pause on rebalance to sell
          saving fund to risky fund while it is bad market.
        </p>

        <p>
          Martin also gradually shifts his asset allocation as he ages - from
          <span class="value">70%</span> stocks/<span class="value">30%</span>
          bonds to a more conservative mix in later years. This approach is to
          reduce the risk of market volatility impact his money when he get
          older.

          <i class="fas fa-gears"></i> How The App Generally Works:
        </h2>
        <p>
          There are four steps to consider when simulating your retirement
          scenario. The first and second steps are essential, while the third
          and fourth steps are optional. The first step focuses on basic info
          and savings, while the second step involves allocating your budget to
          various expenses. The third step pertains to defining retirement
          income or support during retirement, and the fourth step addresses
          risk management related to investments. You can jump to any step
          without following the sequence.
