            <p>We will use Martin's story to demonstrate how the DynaRetire app works by helping him simulate his retirement scenario according to his expectations. The app will generate the result in the form of an Excel file</p>

            
                <h2><i class="fas fa-user-clock"></i> The Brief Scenario: Martin's Retirement Simulation</h2>
                <p>Martin is 45 and wants to plan for early retirement. Below are brief details:</p>
                <ul class="block-list">
                    <li>He and his employer continue to <strong>contribute to the pension fund</strong>, and Martin also <strong>saves extra</strong> in his investments specifically for retirement</li>
                    <li>Martin has <strong>rental income</strong> from his apartment that will continue after he retires. He expects the growth rate to be lower than his expenses inflation</li>
                    <li>Covering his current <strong>living expenses</strong> like food, transport, bills, and insurance. All these expenses have their inflation rate</li>
                    <li>He also plans for future (<strong>old age high medical bills</strong>) that may not be covered by insurance, and <strong>health-related expenses</strong>, with <strong>higher inflation rate</strong> than normal living expenses</li>
                    <li>Dreams of <strong>travelling the world</strong> and travel fewer afterwards and stop travelling upon 80</li>
                    <li>Paying off his <strong>housing loan</strong> until 60</li>
                    <li>Upgrading his <strong>insurance</strong> in a few years, and he expects to pay until 80</li>
                    <li><strong>Changing his car</strong> every few years until a certain age</li>
                    <li>He expects some <strong>expenses to decrease as he ages</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <p>Considering risk management, he wants to manage the risks to his investments in case of market downturns.</p>

                <p>Martin wants to know if he can retire with his ongoing contributions during his working years, his rental income, and his budget for various expenses at different life stages. He also wants to know how long his retirement savings will last.</p>

                <div class="key-info">
                    <p><em>All expense amounts are in today's values. The app will calculate future amounts based on inflation for each year or age. It is however, the income amounts are future amounts, with what we expect to receive based on estimates or agreements, considering the age when we start.</em></p>
                </div>

                <p><em>Note: Some scenarios are for simulation purposes and may not apply to your situation.</em></p>

                <h2><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> The Information About Age, and Saving Information</h2>
                <h3>Age</h3>
                <p>This year is <span class="value">2024</span>. A 45-year-old person plans to retire early at <span class="value">50</span>.</p>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="/content/articles/assets/images/showcase/how-to-setup-age.svg" alt="DynaRetire interface showing age and retirement target setup - current age 45, retirement at 50">
                </div>

                <h3>Savings</h3>
                <p>Martin currently has a pension fund worth <span class="value">$1,000,000</span>, which he expects to grow at a rate of <span class="value">5.5%</span>. However, he can only start withdrawing from this fund when he turns <span class="value">55</span>.</p>
                
                <p>He also has <span class="value">$500,000</span> invested in the S&P 500. Instead of assuming a consistent return rate, he wants to see the impact of retiring during a poor market, using 1999 as the retirement year. Since the fund's history is only available up to 2023, he assumes a return rate of <span class="value">7%</span> for the remaining years.</p>

                <h2><i class="fas fa-chart-line"></i> Dynamic Expenses Following Basic, Desire Lifestyle, and Risk Consideration</h2>
                <p>When simulating retirement expenses, he considers the following:</p>

                <h3><i class="fas fa-plane"></i> Travel Budget: Dream Of Global Travel</h3>
                <p>He dreams of travelling the world during the first two years of his retirement, planning to spend a total of <span class="value">$100,000</span> on global adventures. After that, he expects to spend about <span class="value">$10,000</span> a year on travel when he anticipates slowing down his travels and stopping when he turns <span class="value">75</span>. He expects these costs to rise with an inflation rate of <span class="value">3%</span></p>

                <h3><i class="fas fa-home"></i> Housing Loan Installment: To Be Settled Until Age 60</h3>
                <p>He currently has a housing loan, which requires him to pay <span class="value">$10,000</span> a year. This loan will continue until he turns <span class="value">60</span>, after which he will no longer have this expense.</p>

                <h3><i class="fas fa-shield-halved"></i> Insurance: Upgrade After 10 Years With Inflation Consideration</h3>
                <p>Currently, he pays <span class="value">$4,000</span> a year for his insurance. However, as he approaches <span class="value">56</span> <em>(Note: For simulated purposes, he may consider upgrading now instead, while he is still healthy, avoid exclusion or reject possibility)</em>, he plans to upgrade his medical insurance to ensure it covers him until he turns <span class="value">80</span>. He realizes that the insurance he bought in his 20s may not be sufficient, especially considering the high inflation rates. He estimates this upgrade will cost an additional <span class="value">$3,000</span> per year. While uncertain if payments can cease at any age, he prefers to budget until age <span class="value">80</span>, which aligns with the coverage duration.</p>

                <h3><i class="fas fa-hospital"></i> Medical Bills: Prepare For High Expenses In Later Years</h3>
                <p>Starting at age <span class="value">70</span>, he anticipates needing about <span class="value">$20,000</span> a year (in today's money) for possible health-related expenses, e.g. medicines, follow-ups, physio visits, taking into account the possibility that insurance might not cover all expenses. He expects these costs to rise with an inflation rate of <span class="value">8%</span>. He does not plan for nursing home expenses <em>(Note: he may consider this)</em></p>

                <h3><i class="fas fa-car"></i> Car Replacement Every 7 Years</h3>
                <p>Starting at age <span class="value">51</span>, he plans to buy a new car every <span class="value">7</span> years. Each time he buys a new car, it costs him an extra <span class="value">$60,000</span> beyond what he gets from selling his old car. When he turns <span class="value">72</span>, he expects to be his last car purchase. He doesn't anticipate purchasing a car afterward. He projects that car prices rise with an inflation rate of <span class="value">2%</span>.</p>

                <h3><i class="fas fa-utensils"></i> Food: Luxury Now, Simple Later</h3>
                <p>Currently, he spends about <span class="value">$20,000</span> a year on food, enjoying luxury dining occasionally. However, he anticipates that his lifestyle will become simpler as he ages. By the time he reaches <span class="value">60</span>, he plans to reduce his food budget to <span class="value">$15,000</span> a year. He also expects food prices to increase by about <span class="value">6%</span> annually due to inflation. If the market turns bad, he is prepared to reduce his food expenses to <span class="value">80%</span> of the original budget to minimize spending and more conservatively manage his finances.</p>

                <h3><i class="fas fa-bus"></i> Transport: More Driving Now, Less Later, Stop Afterward</h3>
                <p>Today. he spends about <span class="value">$4,000</span> a year on transport, covering costs such as petrol, insurance, parking, and maintenance. However, he expects these expenses to reduce to <span class="value">$3,000</span> a year after age <span class="value">65</span>, as he plans to drive less. By the time he reaches <span class="value">80</span>, he anticipates that he will stop driving altogether, eliminating these expenses. He expected these expenses to increase by about <span class="value">4%</span> annually due to inflation.</p>

                <h3><i class="fas fa-receipt"></i> Other Expenses</h3>
                <p>He estimates that his annual expenses for bills, clothes, gadgets, repairs, and other miscellaneous items will be around <span class="value">$20,000</span>. He assumes a general inflation rate of <span class="value">3.5%</span> for these expenses over the years.</p>

                <h2><i class="fas fa-money-bill-trend-up"></i> Incomes</h2>
                <p>During his working years, he wants to optimize his contributions to his retirement fund:</p>

                <h3><i class="fas fa-piggy-bank"></i> Pension Fund Contributions</h3>
                <p>He and his employer together contribute <span class="value">$36,000</span> a year to his pension fund. This amount is expected to grow at a rate of <span class="value">2%</span> per year, in line with his salary increases.</p>

                <h3><i class="fas fa-chart-pie"></i> Index Fund Savings</h3>
                <p>Separately, he saves <span class="value">$20,000</span> a year in an index fund. He plans to increase this savings amount by <span class="value">10%</span> each year, leveraging his income growth beyond just the basics.</p>

                <h3><i class="fas fa-building"></i> Rental Income</h3>
                <p>He earns <span class="value">$10,000</span> a year from rental income, which he invests in the same index fund. He expects this rental income to grow by <span class="value">5%</span> per year until he turns <span class="value">55</span>, after which he anticipates it will slow down to a <span class="value">2%</span> annual growth rate. He has no intention to sell this property yet.</p>

                <h2><i class="fas fa-shield-halved"></i> Investment Risk Management: Minimum Spending, Load Balancing, Pause Selling, Asset Allocation</h2>
                <p>To manage investment risks, he has a contingency plan: if the personal history average history returns (since retired year) drop below <span class="value">3%</span> after retirement, he will switch to minimum spending. Additionally, he will avoid selling riskier investments during downturns to prevent losses, prioritizing risk management over growth.</p>

                <p>In terms of asset allocation, he plans to maintain a <span class="value">70%</span> stock and <span class="value">30%</span> bond mix until age <span class="value">60</span>. Then, he will shift to a <span class="value">60%</span> stock and <span class="value">40%</span> bond mix. By the time he reaches <span class="value">65</span>, he plans to further adjust to a <span class="value">50%</span> stock and <span class="value">50%</span> bond allocation. He also intends to rebalance his portfolio annually to stay aligned with these goals.</p>

                <h2><i class="fas fa-gears"></i> How The App Generally Works:</h2>
                <p>There are four steps to consider when simulating your retirement scenario. The first and second steps are essential, while the third and fourth steps are optional. The first step focuses on basic info and savings, while the second step involves allocating your budget to various expenses. The third step pertains to defining retirement income or support during retirement, and the fourth step addresses risk management related to investments. You can jump to any step without following the sequence.</p>

                    <li><strong>Summary:</strong> The first sheet is a summary that displays the total fund balance, expenses, incomes, and profit and loss. It also shows the net balance for the year.</li>
                    <li><strong>Expenses:</strong> The second sheet will provide a detailed breakdown of individual expenses as they occur throughout the year and the total expenses for that year. In the case of an unfavourable market year, a user can configure expenses to switch to minimum spending. In that case, a comment in the column will indicate that the expense amount is based on minimum spending due to the unfavourable market conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Income:</strong> The third sheet will provide a detailed breakdown of individual income as it occurs throughout the year and the total income for that year.</li>
                    <li><strong>Funds Flow:</strong> The fourth screen illustrates the cash flow into and out of the fund. This movement can result from pension fund contributions (directed into the pension fund), additional savings (allocated to the investment fund), profit and loss, withdrawals for expenses (based on withdrawal eligibility and sequence), and rebalancing (which may involve transferring funds from Fund A to Fund B). If a year is marked as an unfavourable market year and there's a pause in balancing from a risky fund to a safer fund, the rebalance column will display a comment indicating the pause.</li>
