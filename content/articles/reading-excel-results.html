          After completing a financial independence simulation in NumberWalk, an
          Excel file is generated. For example,
          similar results

        <ul class="bullet-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Minimum Spending Mode:</strong> During market downturns,
            discretionary expenses (shown in red) can be temporarily reduced by
            applying a percentage to the inflation-adjusted amount. When markets
            recover, expenses automatically return to their full
            inflation-adjusted levels.

                1, it grows to $10,500 in Year 2 and $11,025 in Year 3 with 5%
                inflation. In Year 4, during a market downturn, setting it to
                80% reduces it to $8,820 (80% of $11,576). In Year 5, still in
                downturn, it becomes $9,261 (80% of $12,155). When markets
                recover in Year 6, it returns to the full inflation-adjusted
                amount of $12,763 ($12,155 x 1.05).</em

          <li>
            <strong>High-Inflation Categories:</strong> Medical expenses and
            healthcare costs often experience inflation rates significantly
            higher than general inflation. These expenses tend to grow
            exponentially (due to compounding effects of specialized inflation
            rates) in later years and can rapidly deplete funds if not properly
            accounted for.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Big-Ticket Items:</strong> One-time or periodic major
            purchases can substantially impact portfolio growth.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Expense Evolution:</strong> Watch how spending categories
            shift in importance over time (e.g., travel early, healthcare later)

          Preparing for the Unexpected
        </h3>

        <p>
          While NumberWalk simulations allow you to test different scenarios and
          strategies, it's important to recognize the limitations of any
          planning tool:
        </p>
        <ul class="bullet-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Unplannable Events:</strong> Some life events are too
            extreme or unpredictable to reasonably include in simulations, such
            as extended serious illnesses with massive medical costs spanning
            many years.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Real-time Adjustments:</strong> In actual situation, you'll
            need to make tactical adjustments to your financial strategy that
            high-level plans cannot anticipate. Market conditions may require
            reactions that aren't captured in simulations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Historical Simulations Limitations:</strong> These
            simulations use actual historical market returns. But strategies
            that look promising in theory may yield minimal or no practical
            benefit when in reality. NumberWalk is to give you a sandbox to test
            the theories (e.g. pause rebalance, move to conservative) against
            real historical data. This helps you personally judge whether
            certain protective measures are worth implementing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Psychological Readiness:</strong> Simulations help with
            financial preparedness but cannot fully prepare you for the
            emotional aspects of managing money during market volatility.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Policy Changes:</strong> Future changes to tax laws,
            healthcare systems, or social security benefits may significantly
            impact retirement outcomes in ways that cannot be predicted.
          </li>
        </ul>
