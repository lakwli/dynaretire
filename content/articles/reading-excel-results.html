          After completing a retirement simulation in DynaRetire, an Excel file
          with personalized results is generated. For example, similar results

        </h3>

        <ul class="bullet-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Minimum Spending Mode:</strong> During market downturns,
            discretionary expenses (shown in red) can be temporarily reduced by
            applying a percentage to the inflation-adjusted amount. When markets
            recover, expenses automatically return to their full
            inflation-adjusted levels.

            <blockquote class="example-quote">
              <em
                >Example: Starting with a $10,000 yearly travel budget in Year
                1, it grows to $10,500 in Year 2 and $11,025 in Year 3 with 5%
                inflation. In Year 4, during a market downturn, setting it to
                80% reduces it to $8,820 (80% of $11,576). In Year 5, still in
                downturn, it becomes $9,261 (80% of $12,155). When markets
                recover in Year 6, it returns to the full inflation-adjusted
                amount of $12,763 ($12,155 x 1.05).</em

          />

          <li>
            <strong>High-Inflation Categories:</strong> Medical expenses and
            healthcare costs often experience inflation rates significantly
            higher than general inflation. These expenses tend to grow
            exponentially (due to compounding effects of specialized inflation
            rates) in later retirement years and can rapidly deplete retirement
            funds if not properly accounted for.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Big-Ticket Items:</strong> One-time or periodic major
            purchases can substantially impact portfolio growth.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Expense Evolution:</strong> Watch how spending categories
            shift in importance over time (e.g., travel early, healthcare later)
