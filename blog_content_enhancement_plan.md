# Blog Content Management System Enhancement Plan

## 1. Content Structure

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[content/] --> B[blog/]
    B --> C[posts/]
    C --> D[YYYY-MM-DD-post-slug.md]
    B --> E[assets/]
    E --> F[images/]
    B --> G[metadata.json]
```

### Directory Structure
- `content/blog/` - Root directory for all blog content
- `content/blog/posts/` - Markdown files for each post
- `content/blog/assets/` - Images and other media
- `content/blog/metadata.json` - Optional metadata for posts (e.g., featured status)

## 2. Content Format

Each blog post will be a Markdown file with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml

## 4. Technical Details

### BlogPost Class Updates
```python
@dataclass
class BlogPost:
    # Existing fields remain the same
    content_path: str  # Path to the Markdown file
    raw_content: str  # Raw Markdown content
    html_content: str  # Rendered HTML (cached)
```

### New MarkdownBlogRepository
```python
class MarkdownBlogRepository(BlogRepository):
    def __init__(self, content_dir: str):
        self.content_dir = content_dir
        self.cache = {}  # In-memory cache
        
    def get_all(self) -> List[BlogPost]:
        # Read all markdown files
        # Parse frontmatter
        # Return sorted posts
        
    def get_by_id(self, post_id: str) -> Optional[BlogPost]:
        # Find markdown file by slug
        # Parse and return post
```
