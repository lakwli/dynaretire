# Landing Page Migration Plan

## 1. Complete Landing Page Replacement
- Remove all existing content in templates/marketing/landing.html
- Replace with new content from contents/templates/landing.html
- No need to preserve any existing landing page elements

## 2. Base Template Update
- Update navigation and footer in base.html to match new design
- Move all styles to a separate CSS file
- Update color scheme and design elements

## 3. Static Assets
- Move new static assets to appropriate directories
  * CSS to /static/css/
  * Images to /static/images/
- Update asset references in templates

## 4. Scope Limitations
- Showcase and privacy pages will be updated later
- Plan.html remains unchanged except for inherited navigation/footer
- Focus only on landing page and base template updates

## Implementation Sequence
1. Move static assets first
2. Update base.html with new navigation and footer
3. Replace landing page content completely
4. Test main landing page functionality

## Notes
- Complete replacement of landing page content
- No need to preserve existing landing page elements
- Focus on clean implementation of new design
- Other pages will be handled in separate updates
